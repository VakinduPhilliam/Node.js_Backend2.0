REST APIs are all over the web, but without the proper tools, Node apps require lots of boilerplate code. 

These apps explore next generation concepts in Node.js application development, including; 

> Okta to implement the Client Credentials Flow, which securely connects two machines together without the context of a user.

> API Authentication. 

> Building a cryptocurrency exchange.

> Creating node.js apis with CRUD implementation (get, post, patch, put, delete).

> Steaming Web APIs.


Technology Installations & Middleware:

> Node.js

> PostgreSQL

> Sequelize

> Epilogue

> Okta

> Express

> OAuth

> Jest

> JSON Web Token (JWT)

> Supertest
